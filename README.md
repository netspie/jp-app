# JP App

App that helps you study <b>Japanese</b> language with game elements.

### Purpose

This project is being developed to deepen knowledge in both software engineering and the <b>Japanese</b> language. The app will advance through a series of milestones, from a basic mobile app to a fully developed distributed system. The idea sparked from a desire to learn multiple programming languages and software engineering concepts which, after careful consideration, led to the decision to unify it all into a single great project, but keeping in mind the difficulty of such an endeavor, and starting small and gradually expanding with more complex features.
