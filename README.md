# JP App

An app designed to help you learn Japanese through real-life conversations, practical phrases, flashcards, with gamification elements.

### Purpose

This project is aimed at improving my skills in software engineering and Japanese, while adding a long-held ambition of developing a mobile game. It’s both a technical challenge and a passion project, combining coding, language immersion, and game development. This project is being developed to deepen knowledge in both software engineering and the <b>Japanese</b> language. The app will advance through a series of milestones, from a basic mobile app to a fully developed distributed system. The idea sparked from a desire to get familiar various programming languages and concepts in order to challenge own views related to development paradigms. After careful consideration, it led to the decision of unifying it all into a great single project, but keeping in mind the difficulty of such an endeavor, starting small and gradually expanding it with more complex features.

The project will incorporate the following elements:

_In Context of Features_
- Conversational Learning - with in-depth explanations of grammar and vocabulary.
- Flashcard-Based Practice – Rehearsal of phrases, words, and Japanese characters using a flashcard system
- Gamification Elements - Looting, drawing, collecting, and upgrading cards to enhance engagement
- Monetization Options – A premium currency system or subscription model for additional content and features

_In Context of Technology_
- Mobile Application with Ionic or React Native
- Event-Driven Distributed Backend - composed of multiple services developed in various technologies
- Various Programming Languages - JS/TS, Elixir, C#, Golang, Python
- Serverless Components - like databases, caches, authentication services and more
